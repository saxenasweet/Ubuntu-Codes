//Types of Memory Allocation Techniques:
//a. Dynamic Memory Allocation
//b. static Memory Allocation

//Static Memory Allocation - memory allocation is fixed at compile time

//Dynamic Memory Allocation - memory allocation is done at run time

//Static Memory Allocation - e.g. int a[10] ->memory (40 bytes) will be allocated
//when the program runs and can not be changed till the program ends!

//Static Memory Allocation leads to wastage of memory

//Dynamic Memory Allocation is efficient utilization of memory as memory can
//be allocated,deallocated and even reallocated at run time

//For dynamic memory allocation, the header file stdlib.h is used!
//For dynamic memory allocation, the following functions are used:
//1. malloc()
//2. calloc()
//3. realloc()
//4. free()
