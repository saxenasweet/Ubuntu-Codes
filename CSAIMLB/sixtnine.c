int a[1000] //When you execute the code, memory for
//Storing 1000 integers is fixed.
//This technique of allocating memory is called
//static memory allocation
//Drawback - It leads of wastage of memory
//Under utilization of memory
//Alternative - Use Dynamic Memory Allocation
//malloc - allocation of memory
//calloc - allocation of memory
//free - deallocate or reclaim memory
//realloc - reallocation of memory
//Use the header file stdlib.h for using these functions
