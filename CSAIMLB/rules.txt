Rules of Naming Variables
1. A variable name must always start with either an alphabet or
an underscore
2. A variable name can have numbers, alphabets and underscore
3. A variable name can not be a keyword
4. A variable name is case sensitive

int float -> invalid because float is a keyword
int f,F -> variable names are case sensitive
int __abc; -> valid
