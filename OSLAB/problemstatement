The too much milk problem 

Your family drink milk every morning. 
Mom and Dad are all used to checking the fridge when they arrive home. 
If milk run out, he or she will leave home to buy milk. 
The fridge is small in your home that only one bottle of milk can be put
in it at a time. 
Mom and Dad always arrive home at different time. 
mom.c and dad.c are two programs that simulate the above situation. 
When process mom or dad buys a bottle of milk, it writes string "milk" 
to a file fridge (the file is empty at the beginning).
