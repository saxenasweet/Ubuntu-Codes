To solve the too much milk problem, mom and dad decide to lock the fridge.

There is only one key to open the lock, the one who gets the key can 
check the fridge. That is to say, if mom gets the key and checks fridge,
dad can not open the fridge until mom releases the key. Mom will releases
the key until she ensures there is milk in fridge. 

In mom_sol.c and dad_sol.c, we use semaphore to implement the key. 
Read the following programs and run them to see what will happen.
