Algorithm - a step by step textual description of a problem

Algorithm : Add 2 numbers (integers(-1,-2,3,4,0), Floating (7.6), -> Real Complex Numbers (2+3i)
Step 1: Input A (integer)
Step 2: Input B
Step 3: Let C = A + B
Step 4:  Print C
Step 5: End

Characteristics of an Algorithm
1. It is free from any programming language construct 
2. It is easy to understand.
3. It has finite number of steps (Finiteness)
4. It should give the correct result (Definiteness)

#include<stdio.h>
void main(void)
{
int a,b,c; // a,b,c are integer variables
scanf("%d %d",&a,&b); //%d - data type is integer
c=a+b;
printf("%d",c);
}

Space - Time Complexity - Tradeoff
1. Space - Memory (RAM) - bytes
OR 
2. Processing Time (CPU)  - seconds
